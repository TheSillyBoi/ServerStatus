# Installation
go to discord.com/developers/applications and make a bot
add your bot token to line 30
add the bot to your server
run the program(`python main.py`) or make a build of it using uv and run that (`uv build`)

*If you have an issue with running it, make sure you're in the venv, or make a new venv and add discord and psutil to dependencies(`uv venv && uv pip install discord psutil`)*

## This was written on a whim, if you want more updates, please put them in a GitHub issue or do them yourself in a pull request.
##### I have no major plans to continue work on this, this was just meant to fix an annoyance with me never knowing when modcraft is online, you could always put it on a timer or something else

Thanks, Adrian Tennies
