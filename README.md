# Installation
    set up a venv, preferably using uv(that's just cause I love uv), and install psutil and discord as libraries(should theoretically already be done)
    go to discord.com/developers/applications and make a bot
    add your bot token to line 30
    add the bot to your server
    run the program(python main.py) or make a build of it using uv and run that (uv build)

## This was written on a whim, if you want more updates, please put them in a GitHub issue or do them yourself in a pull request.
### I have no major plans to continue work on this, this was just meant to fix an annoyance with me never knowing when modcraft is online, you could always put it on a timer or something else

Thanks, Adrian Tennies
